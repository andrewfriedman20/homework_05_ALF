# Work Day Calendar Scheduling API - Andrew Friedman



## What the calendar does for you

```md
As a busy employee juggling all of the tasks that work life and home life have in store for you during Covid-19 quarantine, this is a simple web application that allows you to keep track of appointments and the time. Using nothing but some code, this API displays for you which of your self-entered events are coming up, are currently scheduled to occur at the present time, and those that have already passed. Using the local storage of your browser, the app can make a long work day feel manageable.   
```

## What you do to use the calendar

```md
Simply click to select a timeslot (each is 60 minutes and falls between the hours of 9AM and 5PM). When the cursor appears in that slot, type in a breif title or description of the event. After you've finished entering an event into any timeslot, click the 1980s floppy disk icon to the right and boom! It's saved to your schedule.

When timeslots are coming up, they will show up as green. When they are happening right now, they'll be highlighted in red. And, if they've occurred in the past, they'll be in gray.
```

The following screenshot demonstrates the application functionality:
